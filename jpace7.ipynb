I then fitted to a linear model to determine the p-values of all explanatory variables. The p-value for PG5_1RRPQ (the variable I hypothesized would have significant impact) is 0.61318. This has next to no significance, falsifying my hypothesis.\n",

This means our model is a decent predictor, and predicts a good bit better than chance. "
